A cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string "<col><row>" where:

<col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by alphabetical letters.
For example, the 1st column is denoted by 'A', the 2nd by 'B', the 3rd by 'C', and so on.
<row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the integer r.
You are given a string s in the format "<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>", where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2.

Return the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. The cells should be represented as strings in the format mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.

Example 1:

Input: s = "K1:L2"
Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.
Example 2:

Input: s = "A1:F1"
Output: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.

Constraints:

s.length == 5
'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'
'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'
s consists of uppercase English letters, digits and ':'.

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Append k unique positive integers that do not appear in nums to nums such that the resulting total sum is minimum.

Return the sum of the k integers appended to nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,25,10,25], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.
The resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.
The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,6], k = 6
Output: 25
Explanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum.
The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 108
